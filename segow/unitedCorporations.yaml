  The PCs are tasked with uncovering a nefarious plot by the United Corporations, a corrupt political party, to rig the upcoming election in 14 days. The party has been buying up votes and bribing powerful political figures to gain an unfair advantage. In order to stop their plans, the PCs must infiltrate their heavily guarded headquarters and uncover evidence of their wrongdoings and present it to the authorities before the election. 

  The United Corporations have a large network of informants and spies, so the PCs must be careful not to arouse suspicion as they try to uncover the evidence. Additionally, the party has access to a powerful AI that can detect any attempts to access their servers and will send a security team if alerted. The PCs must use their wits and skills to outwit the AI and access the evidence without setting off any alarms. 

  Once the PCs have obtained the evidence, they must deliver it to the authorities so that the election can be held fairly and the corrupt political party be brought to justice. However, the United Corporations will not let the PCs go so easily, so they must escape the city and make their way to safety while evading their pursuers. 

  The PCs must act quickly if they are to stop the United Corporations from rigging the election and restoring justice to the city.
