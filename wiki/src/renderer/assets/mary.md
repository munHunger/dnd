Mary is a merchant in the city of Anstad. She does not have any wares, but if you ask her for something she will always provide you with it. The way it works is that you ask her for something special(she prefers not to trade in mundane items) and she walks away with your request. A while later she will find you, with the item you requested.

She is capable of getting almost anything, at a price though.

Mary isn't a normal human, instead she is actually Mouqol in disguise. Mouqol is the god of trade and loves trading in rare goods.
