The group is tasked with transporting some sludge from the mining outpost into town. This should be done without involvement of guards as it might not be strictly legal.

They are given the quest by Merran Rustfall and should talk to Irrem Boulderfeast who is the foreman of the mines and can give them the sludge. The sludge should be transported to a shed with a green door and red window frames.

When arriving at the outpost they meet Mudath Firsttale who has taken some hostages as he believes that they should all share the sludge instead of their boss simply selling it on the black market.

The group can solve this by fighting their way out or negotiating their way out.

Mudath's advantage in this situation is that the place is rigged with explosives and there are 3 independent triggers
