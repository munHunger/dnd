Flying Elephant is the second oldest inn in Anstad. It is a 2 story building with the first floor being a pub and the second living areas. On the first floor there is a square bar in the middle with rustic pillars in each corner. At each side there are booths for up to 7 people. and on the far end there are some stairs to the second floor as well as a kitchen to the left of the stairs.

The walls are 3m high full of paintings of "influential people". They have a wood border all around.

The cieling is supported by old wood beams that are imported from the main land.
