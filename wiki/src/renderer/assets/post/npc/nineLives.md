The Trade Prince of Information for the Board of Anstad.

Very Little is know about this individual.

Only the other trade princes know that the position is occupied, even if it might seem that it isn't the case. (Add link to statue description.)

If they attend a board meeting they do so under heavy disguise of both magic and normal means. Often an underling is sent as a decoy to meetings.
