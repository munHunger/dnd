Peitur was the captain aboard the ship that attacked the party.
He has since lost his entire crew and is now in custody of the party.

Currently he is tricked by _fiddlewink_ into believing that he is cursed and has **24 hours** to get information about where to find _Harren Ironfists_ stolen loot.
