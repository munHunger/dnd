The younger of the Manforth siblings, but the more successful.

She is the Trade Princess of Entertainment of the Board of Anstad.

If you have any desire of entertainment Neyana will give you the possibility to indulge in it, for a price of course.

Has a trusty body guard named Urek.

Despises her brother Vincent Manforth since he spoiled most of the family wealth and only has a small business to show for it.
