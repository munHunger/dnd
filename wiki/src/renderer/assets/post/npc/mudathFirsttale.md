Mudath was a "normal" miner with a history of starting riots and mutiny in order to help him and those near him. He has a way of twisting the truth in a way to make it seem as if he is for equality, which is convincing enough for the simple minded.

After a run-in with the players he has decided to start his own mining company. which might ultimately start a resistance movement against the strict anti-sludge laws (pro-sludge movement).
