He is the current trade prince of exploration of the Board of Anstad.

Formerly a wood elf lord in the old world he set out with his people to claim the new land of Eldor for all Wood Elves. He believes it to be the promised land in the tales of old, their birth place.

He only tolerates the current situation and state of Eldor because an all out war would be suicidal for his people at the current time.

He is rarely if ever in the city of Anstad, but rather out and about (North of Anstad).
