Haywood is the **owner** of 3 pirate squads in _Orbb cress_.
As the owner he is rarely seen on a boat or on a specific mission. Instead he stays at the @t[harbour] **managing relations** between his pirate squads and the drow in the underworld.

**Feared** by his peers as his calm emotionless expression gives of a feel of @t[insanity]. This fear is backed up by him being willing to take action whenever needed.

Nothing stops Haywood from earning more money or power. It doesn't matter who he crosses as long as he can get away with it.
