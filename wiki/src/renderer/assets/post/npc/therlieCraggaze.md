Therlie is the scout and thief for _Haywood Lux_.
She is not the fast or the most nimble, but her short height and appearance makes her blend in quite well, making her hard to spot.

Being raised in _Orb Cress_ makes her quite used to harsh environments and torture from Drows. **Threats doesn't work** on her, although she crumbles quickly under any form of **physical action**.
