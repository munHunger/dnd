The owner and main broker for the firm "Manforths comfy homes for those or normal size and all others.".

Normal in this sense meaning Halflings, gnomes, goblins and short dwarfs.

Of course there is housing for other races as well but the price might go up! (It will!)

Rent a house - 7 gp per bed per week.

Buy:

5 bed house - 5000 GP. (a small fee might be needed aswell)

10 bed house - 9375 GP.
