# Sludge

The sludge is a biproduct from when you corrode the mineral on Eldor. The main reason for wanting to corrode this mineral is to get "easy" access to the gold veins inside of it.

There is a side effect of the sludge which is that if consumed one can perform magical feats, even if you are normaly not a spellcaster.

If consumed you pick one spell to cast. The spell must be a second level or lower. Any first level spell can be cast a second level spell if desired. When casting the spell, roll 1d6, on a 4 or up it succeds and is performed without any problems. If however you do not succed on the roll, roll 1d100 and consult the table below for it's effect. Note that if not stated otherwise the spell does still take effect.
