The Beating Heart is an arena of battle.

Here Spectators can watch gladiators best each other both in lethal and non lethal combat.

Both Singles, Doubles and Groups are categories. For each of these categories also monster fights are common.

Some gladiators are slaves but others sign up willingly to either a long or short term contract for a set number of fights.

Nymdiin Despath is the Master of the arena, he and his underlings are responsible for handling the sign up process and match making.
