# The Neighbour execution

The team meets a depressed man(Fredrik Olofsson) at a pub who sighs and say that he is lucky that "he"(Thormond Pebblejaw) atleast sent a priest. He is of course seeing the group as executioners who has come to kill him. He talks about a neighbour feud that went wrong to say the least. His neighbour was jealous of his incredibly good looking garden. This then escalated after he slept with his neighbours wife(Amanda Edmonton) and he found out. They started seeing eachother after a festival where they met eachother.

After some arguing, he offers the group some gold to either execute him in a merciful way, or help him kill his neighbour. which might not be too easy as there are hobgoblins guarding his home. There is also the option of talking to the neighbor and helping him get his wife back and burning down the garden
