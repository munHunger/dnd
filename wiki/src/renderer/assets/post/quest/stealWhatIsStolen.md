# Stealing what has already been stolen

@i[type][plot hook][quest]
@i[status][incomplete]
@i[reward][boat][Peitur][25000 g worth of minerals and gems]
@i[xp][1300]

The quest starts of with the group moving back towards the boat in hopes of _Peitur_ having returned with information from his employer about where to find the @t[stolen goods].

On their way to the boat they sense that they are @t[stalked]. A **19DC perception** will reveal the scout _Therlie Craggaze_.

Back at the boat an @t[ambush] is waiting. The upper deck is completely empty and no one is in sight, a **22DC perception** will reveal the ambush as you hear people shuffling around under deck. The ambush is being staged by Peiturs employer _Haywood Lux_.

Haywood is aware of what the group want and suggests a fair trade. They @t[steal] back the loot and gets to keep **50%** of it. If they return it to Haywood, they get to keep the _boat and Peitur_ as a slave. If on the other hand they don't return it within **2 days** the boat will be sent to another crew under Haywood and Peitur will be killed as he is of no use.

The loot is currently in storage near the **entrance to the underdark**.
When **night falls** a spider carrige will be brought up and it is scheduled to bring down the loot.

The storage is located next to the entrance and the main storage area is guarded and maintaned by the brute _Rahjin_ under the control of _Szorafein Hun'ervs_. The loot area is sectioned of and Haywood has purchased a section of it marked with his name on a post next to it.

To get the loot, the party may want to get a carrige as it is otherwise too much to carry. Luckily there is a stable, _copper grove_ close by where you can purchase or rent a spider with a large enough cart. It could be a good idea to **park the cart** right next to storage and then @t[distract] the guards while you tear down the **stone walls** around the storage.

All of this sounds fine and dandy if it wasn't for the fact that Haywood tiped of a private guardforce named _the phantoms_ that will do their best to kill or kidnap parts of the party
